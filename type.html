        <h1>All About Boston!</h1>
        <!-- Start Lead -->
        <p>One of the oldest cities in the United States, Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan colonists from England. It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Siege of Boston.</p>

        <p>Here's what I see all across this great city - people working together to make Boston a better place to live and to raise children, to grow and pursue dreams.</p>

        <!-- End Blockquote -->
        <p>Boston's early European settlers had first called the area Trimountaine (after its "three mountains" only traces of which remain today) but later renamed it Boston after Boston, Lincolnshire, England, from which several prominent colonists had come.</p>
        <p>The renaming, on September 7, 1630 (old style), was by Puritan colonists from England, who had moved over from Charlestown earlier that year in quest of fresh water. Their settlement was initially limited to the Shawmut Peninsula, at that time surrounded by the Massachusetts Bay and Charles River and connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. The peninsula is known to have been inhabited as early as 5000 BC.</p>

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Boston has an area of 89.6 square miles (232.1 km2) - 48.4 square miles (125.4 km2) (54.0%) of land and 41.2 square miles (106.7 km2) (46.0%) of waterâ€”and is the country's third most densely populated city that is not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>This is largely attributable to the rarity of annexation by New England towns. The city's official elevation, as measured at Logan International Airport, is 19 ft (5.8 m) above sea level. The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill at 330 feet (100 m) above sea level, and the lowest point is at sea level. Situated near the Atlantic Ocean, Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with an ocean coastline.</p>

        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <p>In 2010 Boston was estimated to have 617,594 residents (a density of 12,200 persons/sq mile, or 4,700/km2) living in 272,481 housing units a 5% population increase over 2000. Some 1.2 million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during work hours, and as many as 2 million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.</p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <!-- Start Lead -->
        <p>Boston has teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues plus Major League Soccer, and has won 34 championships in these leagues, as of 2013.</p>
        <!-- End Lead -->
        <p>It is one of five cities (along with New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit) to have won championships in all four major sports. It has been suggested that Boston is the new "TitleTown, USA", as the city's professional sports teams have won eight championships since 2001: Patriots (2001, 2003, and 2004), Red Sox (2004, 2007, and 2013), Celtics (2008), and Bruins (2011). No other city has won major championships in the four current major American sports leagues in as short a time period; only New York has done so faster, in the days of the old American Basketball League.</p>
        <h3>Red Sox</h3>
        <p>The Boston Red Sox, a founding member of the American League of Major League Baseball in 1901, play their home games at Fenway Park, near Kenmore Square in the city's Fenway section.</p>
        <h3>Bruins</h3>
        <p>The Bruins have been in existence since 1924, and are the National Hockey League's third-oldest team and are the oldest in the United States. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League.</p>
        <h3>Celtics</h3>
        <p>The Boston Celtics were founding members of the Basketball Association of America, one of the two leagues that merged to form the NBA. They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <h3>Patriots</h3>
        <p>The New England Patriots of the National Football League were founded in 1960 as the Boston Patriots, changing their name in 1971 to better reflect its status as New England's team. The Patriots play their home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts.</p>
