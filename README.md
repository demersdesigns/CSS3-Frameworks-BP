Intro to CSS3 Frameworks - Fall 2014
===============
A simple site design used as a teaching aid for the Intro to CSS Frameworks immersive session at [Startup Institute Boston]. This starter site served as a way to show students the benefits and responsibilities of using a framework. As part of a live-coding session, I showed the students the basics of implementing Bootstrap to a basic semantic HTML layout.
